                <p>Fireworks go off at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the Rams are hosting
                    the Houston Texans for a preseason game on a blue-sky  August afternoon. Some
                    boisterous, fresh from their tailgates, hang like gargoyles over the railing above
                    the players’ tunnel. </p>
                <p>When the Rams cheerleaders trot out in diagonal lines, ready to welcome the
                    home-team starters, a ruddy-faced man wearing canary yellow Rams horns looks
                    confused. “Who’s the dude!?” he screams, sounding outraged.
                    His friends laugh and point. </p>
                <h5>What Type of Relationship Are You Looking For?</h5>
                <p>Before deciding which dating site to sign up for, consider your desired outcome.
                Whether you’re looking to meet interesting people, start dating again after
                a heartbreak or searching for that person to start a family with, dating sites
                    aren’t a “one size fits all” deal.</p>

                <p>EliteSingles, for example, is best suited for daters seeking a serious relationship.
                While signing up is a lengthy process involving a thorough questionnaire, the
                result is quality matches with the potential for long-term commitment.</p>

                <p>Another site offering great results for people looking for a serious relationship,
                is OurTime, which is dedicated to singles over the age of 50
                looking for companionship, love, and romance. No matter what type of relationship
                    you’re looking for, there’s a dating site.</p>
