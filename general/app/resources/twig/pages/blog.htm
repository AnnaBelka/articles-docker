            <p>Fireworks go off at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the Rams are hosting the
                Houston Texans for a preseason game on a blue-sky  August afternoon. Some boisterous,
                fresh from their tailgates, hang like gargoyles over the railing above the players’ tunnel.
                When the Rams cheerleaders trot out in diagonal lines, ready to welcome the home-team
                starters, a ruddy-faced man wearing canary yellow Rams horns looks confused. “Who’s the
                dude!?” he screams, sounding outraged. His friends laugh and point. </p>
