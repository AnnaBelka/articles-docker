    <p >Fireworks go off at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where the Rams are hosting the Houston
        Texans for a preseason game on a blue-sky
        August afternoon. Some boisterous fans, fresh from their tailgates, hang like gargoyles over the railing above
        the players’ tunnel. When the
        Rams cheerleaders trot out in diagonal lines, ready to welcome the home-team starters, a ruddy-faced man wearing
        canary yellow Rams
        horns looks confused. “Who’s the dude!?” he screams, sounding outraged. His friends laugh and point. </p>

<div  class="home-questions"><h3 >Choose the Top Dating Site: 3 Questions to Guide
    the Decision</h3>
    <p  class="home-questions-title">1 - What Type of Relationship Are You Looking For?</p>
    <p >Before deciding which dating site to sign up for, consider your desired outcome. Whether
        you’re looking to meet interesting people, start dating
        again after a heartbreak or searching for that person to start a family with, dating sites aren’t a “one size
        fits all” deal.</p>
    <p >EliteSingles, for example, is best suited for daters seeking a serious relationship. While
        signing up is a lengthy process involving a thorough
        questionnaire, the result is quality matches with the potential for long-term commitment.</p>
    <p >Another site offering great results for people looking for a serious relationship, is OurTime,
        which is dedicated to singles over the age of 50
        looking for companionship, love, and romance. No matter what type of relationship you’re looking for, there’s a
        dating site.</p>
    <p  class="home-questions-title">2 - Do You Prefer Being Matched or Searching Independently?</p>
    <p >Personal preferences matter with online dating—just as they do with offline dating. Some
        singles want to search through profiles before
        deciding who to chat with, while other people feel more comfortable being set up. Luckily, the world of online
        dating has answers for both.</p>
    <p >One of the major benefits of using a dating site is the ability to filter potential matches
        according to the values and characteristics that
        matter most to you. This immediate screening saves time and energy by ruling out users who aren’t
        compatible.</p>
    <p >For singles who want to be set up, sites like Zoosk bring matches straight to your inbox on a
        daily basis. With Zoosk’s patented Behavioral
        Matchmaking technology, the site studies users’ likes and interests to provide the most compatible matches.</p>
    <p  class="home-questions-title">3 - Which Features Matter Most?</p>
    <p >While dating sites all provide singles with the same essential service—a platform to meet new
        people and find a potential partner—each site
        does it in a different way.</p>
    <p >Compare the features available on the best dating sites to choose the right one for you.
        Differentiating features include online chat or video
        chat, safety features like photo verification, and dating games. Choose a dating site that offers the features
        which are most important to you.</p></div>
